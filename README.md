This is a library which converts markdown to XAML.
In the solution there is also a demo application to play around with the parser.

This is a very basic parsing library, so currently only the following markdown symbols are supported:
# Headers
### Header1
## Header2
# Header3

# Checkboxes
- [ ] Item 1
- [x] Item 2

# Bold
**Bold text**

# Italic
*italic text*

# Regular list
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

# Regular paragraph
This is regular text.
